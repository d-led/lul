lul
===

This project shows an example of using lua as a scriptable ui logic component.

The binding is done via [luabind](http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind/docs.html)
and the dependency injection using [wallaroo](https://code.google.com/p/wallaroo/).

Use at your own risk.

The explanation will follow shortly.
